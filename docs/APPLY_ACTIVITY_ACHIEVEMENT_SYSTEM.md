## 🎉 What's Been Built

I've implemented a **fully automated Activity Feed and Achievement System** that will make your platform feel alive! Here's what's ready:

   - 🎯 First Steps (10 pts) - Complete first lesson
   - 📚 Module Master (50 pts) - Complete first module
   - 💬 Discussion Starter (20 pts) - Create first discussion post
   - 📅 Event Enthusiast (15 pts) - Attend first event
   - 📖 Book Lover (30 pts) - Finish first book
   - 🤝 Helping Hand (25 pts) - Get 5 likes on posts
   - 🌅 Early Bird (10 pts) - Complete lesson before 8 AM

   - ✍️ Reflection Writer (30 pts) - Write 10 reflections
   - 👥 Community Builder (35 pts) - Get 10 followers
   - 🏆 All-In (200 pts) - Complete all modules

3. **Beautiful Achievements Display** - New dashboard component showing:
   - Earned achievements with icons
   - Locked achievements (grayed out)
   - Total points earned
   - Progress bar
   - Hover tooltips with details

## 🚀 How to Apply the Migrations

You have **2 new migration files** that need to be applied to your Supabase database:

- `supabase/migrations/00032_activity_triggers.sql` - Activity feed automation
- `supabase/migrations/00033_achievement_triggers.sql` - Achievement automation

### Option 1: Via Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
3. Open the first migration file: `supabase/migrations/00032_activity_triggers.sql`
4. Copy the entire contents
5. Paste into a new query in the SQL Editor
6. Click **Run** (or press Cmd+Enter)
7. Repeat steps 3-6 for the second migration file: `supabase/migrations/00033_achievement_triggers.sql`
8. Verify both ran successfully (you should see "Success. No rows returned" or similar)

### Option 2: Via Supabase CLI

If you want to link your project to use the CLI:

```bash
# Link your project (you'll need your project ref from Supabase dashboard)
supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF

# Push the migrations
supabase db push

# Or push specific migrations
supabase migration up
```

## 🧪 Testing the System

Once migrations are applied, test each feature:

### Test 5: Module Completion

1. Complete ALL lessons in a module
2. ✅ Should see "Completed a module" activity
3. ✅ If it's your first module, should earn "Module Master" achievement

## 📊 Database Triggers Explained

### Activity Triggers (`00032_activity_triggers.sql`)

These triggers run automatically when:

- **`lesson_progress` table updated** → Creates lesson completion activity + checks for module completion
- **`discussion_posts` table insert** → Creates discussion post activity
- **`reading_progress` table updated** → Creates book finished activity (when status = 'finished')
- **`event_registrations` table insert** → Creates event registration activity

### Achievement Triggers (`00033_achievement_triggers.sql`)

These triggers run automatically when:

- **Lesson completed** → Checks for: First Steps, Early Bird, Night Owl
- **Module completed** → Checks for: Module Master, All-In
- **Discussion post created** → Checks for: Discussion Starter
- **Book finished** → Checks for: Book Lover
- **Reflection added** → Checks for: Reflection Writer
- **User gets follower** → Checks for: Community Builder

**Note:** Streak achievements (Consistency Champion, Dedication Master) need to be checked separately, typically on user login.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Activities not appearing?

1. Check that migrations ran successfully
2. Verify the triggers exist:
   ```sql
   SELECT trigger_name, event_manipulation, event_object_table 
   FROM information_schema.triggers 
   WHERE trigger_schema = 'public';
   ```
3. Check for errors in Supabase logs

### Achievements not being awarded?

1. Verify `achievements` table has data:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM achievements;
   ```
2. Check `user_achievements` table for your user:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM user_achievements WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID';
   ```
3. Look for errors in Supabase function logs

### No notifications appearing?

1. Check `notifications` table:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM notifications WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID' ORDER BY created_at DESC;
   ```
2. Ensure notifications component is working (refresh page)
