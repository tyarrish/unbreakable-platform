import { ActivityFeed } from '@/components/social/activity-feed'

// In any page
<ActivityFeed limit={20} showFilters={true} />
```

<NotificationCenter userId={currentUserId} />
```

<Leaderboard limit={10} currentUserId={userId} />
```

### Streak Indicator

```tsx
import { StreakIndicator } from '@/components/ui/streak-indicator'

  showLongest={true}
/>
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run database migration: `supabase db push`
- [ ] Verify all tables created with correct RLS policies
- [ ] Test member directory search and filtering
- [ ] Test follow/unfollow functionality
- [ ] Test global search (Cmd+K)
- [ ] Verify notifications appear in real-time
- [ ] Test achievement unlocking
- [ ] Verify leaderboard displays correctly
- [ ] Test activity feed real-time updates
- [ ] Check responsive design on mobile

## Performance Considerations

1. **Pagination**: Activity feed and member directory use pagination
2. **Debouncing**: Search queries are debounced (300ms)
3. **Subscriptions**: Real-time features use Supabase subscriptions efficiently
4. **Indexing**: Database indexes added for frequently queried fields
5. **Lazy Loading**: Heavy components can be lazy loaded if needed

## Security & Privacy

1. **RLS Policies**: All tables have Row Level Security enabled
2. **User Privacy**: Users control their own profile visibility
3. **Notification Privacy**: Users only see their own notifications
4. **Follow Privacy**: All follows are public within the cohort
5. **Activity Privacy**: All activity is visible to cohort members (fosters community)

## Next Steps

1. **Test Implementation**: Thoroughly test all features
2. **Gather Feedback**: Get user feedback on new features
3. **Iterate**: Refine based on usage patterns
4. **Phase 2**: Implement remaining features from the plan
5. **Analytics**: Add tracking to understand feature usage
6. **Optimize**: Performance tuning based on real usage

## Design Philosophy

All features follow the RLTE design system:
- Nature-inspired color palette (rogue-forest, rogue-gold, rogue-sage)
- Glassmorphism effects
- Rounded corners (0.5rem)
- Smooth transitions
- Generous whitespace
- Clear typography hierarchy

## Support & Maintenance

For issues or questions:
1. Check RLS policies if data access issues occur
2. Verify Supabase subscriptions are properly cleaned up
3. Monitor database query performance
4. Review error logs for failed operations
5. Ensure all foreign key relationships are intact
