## Step 2: Set Storage Policies

After creating the bucket, set these policies:

### Policy 1: Public Read Access

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Public can read videos"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'lesson-videos');
```

### Policy 2: Admins Can Upload

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Admins and facilitators can upload videos"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'lesson-videos' AND
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM profiles
    WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role IN ('admin', 'facilitator')
  )
);
```

### Policy 3: Admins Can Delete

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Admins and facilitators can delete videos"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'lesson-videos' AND
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM profiles
    WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role IN ('admin', 'facilitator')
  )
);
```
